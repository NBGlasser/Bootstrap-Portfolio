# Bootstrap-Portfolio
## What was I supposed to be doing?
Rebuilding the recommended site from Homework 1 using bootstrap

## Technologies used:
* HTML
* CSS
* Bootstrap

## What I did:
I copied over the HTML from the sample portfolio because my version was not the best, I then used bootstrap instead of a custom CSS document to style the pages
